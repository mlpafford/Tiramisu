# Tiramisu
This Hackday project was written by a team of five, see homepage for names.

Project link will expire by end of December. 

Our goal was to set up a website for young women in STEM to ask questions anonymously and get feedback from professionals in that specific field. We wanted to eliminate the elements of hostility that can be found when asking "beginner" questions on a site like StackExchange. We also wanted to foster mentorship. 

The site would find several matches for the user to choose as a responder. These responders could choose to stay anonymous, or "reveal" themselves during the conversations. If both the user and mentor chose each other, then the contact information (LinkedIn profiles) would then be revealed. 


As of the end of our Hackday, we had all user interface working (clickable buttons, example profiles, responsive forms) but no real transactions occuring or information stored. Our chat relies on a local server and therefore will only function when the host computer is running.
